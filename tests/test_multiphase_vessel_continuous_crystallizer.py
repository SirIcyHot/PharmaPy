"""Withdrawal and flow contracts for the continuous crystallizer.

Tests evaluate ``unit_model`` at t = 0, so they need no integrator.

Units: charge mass [kg], temp [K], x_grid [um], distrib [#/(um m**3)],
feed [kg/s], vol_flow [m**3/s], residence time [s], d(mass_j)/dt [kg/s],
d(distrib)/dt [#/(um m**3 s)].

Every test runs undersaturated, where nucleation and growth are inactive, so
the only mechanism acting on the crystal population is withdrawal through the
product stream. Formation is covered in the batch module.
