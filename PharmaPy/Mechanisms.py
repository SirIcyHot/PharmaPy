        distrib_basis : str, optional
            What ``distrib_init`` is expressed in. ``'intensive'``, the
            default and this stack's storage convention, is a number density
            per m3 of slurry. The other three are input formats, converted on
            the way in so that what is stored is always intensive:

            - ``'extensive'``   absolute counts; needs ``vol_slurry``
            - ``'vol_perc'``    a volume-fraction shape, the legacy
              ``SolidPhase`` default; needs ``basis_mass`` and ``vol_slurry``
            - ``'mass_perc'``   a mass-fraction shape; same requirements

        vol_slurry : float, optional
            Slurry volume the extensive form refers to [m3]. Required for
            every basis but ``'intensive'``, because the conversion is a
            division by it and a solid on its own does not have one.
        basis_mass : float, optional
            Solid mass the fraction shape refers to [kg]. Required for
            ``'vol_perc'`` and ``'mass_perc'``, which carry only a shape.
